#Maze-GUI
##Author: Kuochuan Ponzio
This program is a game designed to be solved by the user. The aim of the game is to use the arrow keys to move your avatar
(the small green square) from the top left of the window to the bottom right.  

While the program is running the field of view that the user has of the maze will shrink.  
The user can reset the field of view by clicking (left click) on the maze but doing so will result in a point reduction.  
The users score starts and 10,000 and goes down from there depending on how many times the user resets the field of view, how many moves it takes them to solve the maze, and how long it takes them to solve the maze.

This program is written in C++ and uses the OpenGL/GLUT framework to dsiplay the graphics. In order to run it you must have OpenGL installed
